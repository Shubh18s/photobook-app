                <strong class="font-medium">We do not directly collect any personal identifying information, usage data, device information, or crash logs from you or your device.</strong> Our App is designed to function entirely on your device without transmitting such data to us or any third parties.

                2. User-Generated Content (e.g., Photonotes) and Sharing with Third-Party Apps
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Our App allows you to create "photonotes," which are user-generated content consisting of text and, optionally, images that you choose to include. These photonotes are created and stored locally on your device within the App's private storage.

                Sharing with Third-Party Applications:
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                A core feature of our App is to enable you to share these photonotes with other third-party applications already installed on your device (e.g., messaging apps like WhatsApp, email clients, social media platforms).
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                <li>When you choose to share a photonote, our App initiates the transfer of this content (the text and any associated images) to your selected third-party application via standard Android system mechanisms (Intents).</li>
                <li><strong class="font-medium">Photobook does not directly transmit this shared content over a network to its own servers or any third-party servers.</strong> We facilitate the transfer of the content from our App to the third-party application you select.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-medium">Disclaimer Regarding Third-Party Apps:</strong> Please be aware that once a photonote or any other content is shared with a third-party application, its subsequent collection, use, storage, and transmission (including any encryption or lack thereof) are governed by the privacy policy and terms of service of that specific third-party application. <strong class="font-medium">Photobook does not control, nor is it responsible for, the data handling practices of these external applications.</strong> We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party applications you use for sharing.</li>
            </ul>

                3. How We Use Information
            </h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                <li><strong class="font-medium">To provide App functionality:</strong> Our App processes the photonotes solely on your device to enable you to create and manage them, and to facilitate their sharing with other applications as per your instruction.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-medium">We do not use your information for analytics, crash reporting, or any other purposes, as we do not collect any such data.</strong></li>
            </ul>

                4. Information Sharing and Disclosure
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                <strong class="font-medium">We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any personal identifying information, usage data, device information, or crash logs to outside parties.</strong>
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                <li><strong class="font-medium">User-Initiated Sharing:</strong> As described in Section 2, you explicitly choose to share your photonotes with other applications. This is entirely under your control, and our App does not retain or transmit this data after the sharing action is initiated.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-medium">No Third-Party Services (for data collection/sharing):</strong> Our App does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising, or crash reporting services that would collect or share your data.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-medium">Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency). However, as we do not collect personal data, such instances would be extremely rare and limited to any data that might exist transiently on your device and be subject to legal process.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Section 5: Data Security -->
            <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-4 mt-8">
                5. Data Security
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                We implement reasonable security measures designed to protect the information processed by our App on your device. However, please be aware that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-medium text-blue-500 mb-3">
                Regarding "Encryption in Transit":
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                As explained in Section 2, when you share content with other third-party applications, the encryption of that data during its transmission by those third-party apps is beyond our control and subject to their respective policies. Our App does not directly transmit user data over a network, therefore, the concept of "encryption in transit" for data directly from our app to a server does not apply to our app's operations.

                <li><strong class="font-medium">Accessing/Deleting Photonotes:</strong> Since photonotes are stored locally on your device within the App, you can manage or delete them directly within the App's interface. Deleting the App from your device will typically delete all locally stored photonotes associated with the App.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-medium">No Opt-out Needed:</strong> As we do not collect personal data, there are no specific opt-out mechanisms required for data collection.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-medium">Device Permissions:</strong> You can manage permissions for our App through your device's settings.</li>

                Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of [e.g., 13, or the relevant age in your target regions, e.g., 16 for GDPR]. We do not knowingly collect any personal identifying information from children under [e.g., 13].
