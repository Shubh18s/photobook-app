    <h3>**PhotoBook Privacy Policy**</h3>

    **Effective Date:** July 20, 2025

    This Privacy Policy describes how Shubhdeep Singh ("we," "our," or "us") handles information in connection with your use of the PhotoBook mobile application (the "App").

    <p><strong>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</strong></p>

    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This App is designed with your privacy in mind, and we want to be transparent about how data is handled.</p>

    <p><strong>Information We Do NOT Collect</strong></p>

    <p>We <b>do not</b> collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage information from your use of the App. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.</li>
        <li>Information from crash logs, analytics, or any other telemetry.</li>
        <li>Any content you create within the App, such as photobook notes and images. All such data is stored locally on your device and is not accessed, collected, or transmitted by us.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Third-Party Services</strong></p>

    <p>This App uses <b>Google AdMob</b> to display advertisements. AdMob is a service provided by Google.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>AdMob's Data Collection:</b> AdMob may collect certain information to serve personalized and non-personalized ads, such as your device's advertising ID, IP address, device type, operating system, and app usage information. This data is collected and processed by Google AdMob according to their own privacy policy.</li>
        <li><b>Purpose of Data Collection by AdMob:</b> This data is used by AdMob to provide and improve advertising services, including showing relevant ads, measuring ad performance, and preventing fraudulent activity.</li>
        <li><b>Your Choices Regarding Personalized Advertising:</b> You can opt out of personalized advertising by Google AdMob by visiting your device settings (e.g., Google Settings &gt; Ads on Android devices). You can also learn more about how Google uses information from sites or apps that use their services by visiting Google's Privacy &amp; Terms at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>.</li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Data Security</strong></p>

    <p>Since we do not collect any personal data from you, there is no user data stored on our servers to protect. All your photobook notes and images remain exclusively on your device. AdMob, as a third-party service, has its own security measures in place.</p>

    <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us.

    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
